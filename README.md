### MyBinder Service

The MyBinder service launches a live programming environment in the Cloud and allows you to interact with the course notebooks. However the changes to these notebooks are **temporary** and do not persist next time you open the notebook. For these types of changes it is best to download the notebooks to your computer and run ``jupyter notebook`` in a terminal (or powershell in windows) in the folder that contains your notebook files.
